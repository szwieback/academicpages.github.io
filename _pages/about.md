I use remote sensing to characterize and understand land surface processes in permafrost regions. My research program strives to combine technical advances in remote sensing of high-latitude regions with an improved understanding of the rapidly changing Arctic. The remote sensing component is focused on developing scattering models and estimation techniques for a range of observation modalities. By combining these remote sensing advances with field observations and models, I aim to quantify and predict permafrost terrain dynamics. My primary objectives are to map ground ice contents on regional scales and to identify the drivers and controls of various types of permafrost degradation and stabilization.
