My main research interests are in microwave remote sensing and land surface processes in permafrost regions.

My current research is focused on monitoring and analysing permafrost dynamics. This work is being conducted at the [University of Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca/), where I am an [SNSF](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx) postdoctoral fellow. The aims of my fellowship are to develop and assess fine-scale methods for estimating soil moisture in the tundra and to incorporate soil moisture estimates into permafrost monitoring schemes. 

Previously, I was a PhD student and postdoctoral fellow at [ETH Zurich](http://www.eo.ifu.ethz.ch/), Switzerland. My PhD project focused on the radar remote sensing technique differential SAR interferometry, which can provide synoptic estimates of subtle surface deformations. I investigated how soil moisture and vegetation changes impact these measurements and how the associated errors can be either corrected for or harnessed to estimate soil moisture changes.
