## Permafrost terrain dynamics

|<a href="http://szwieback.github.io/files/kivalinats.png"><img src="http://szwieback.github.io/files/kivalinats.png" align="left" width="390" ></a> | Where permafrost is rich in ground ice, warming and disturbances can induce terrain subsidence, slumping, and collapse. However, we lack spatially resolved information on the drivers and controls of permafrost degradation and stabilization. In particular, we lack fine-scale maps of ground ice over most of the Arctic. I am currently exploring the subseasonal dynamics of thaw subsidence to constrain ice contents at the top of the permafrost. |

*Acceleration of seasonal subsidence measured by Sentinel-1 in an extreme summer such as 2019 is an indicator of ice-rich permafrost.*

## Scattering models and estimation algorithms for Arctic environments
|<a href="http://szwieback.github.io/files/speckle.png"><img src="http://szwieback.github.io/files/speckle.png" align="left" width="390" ></a> | Arctic ecosystems present numerous challenges for remote sensing models and estimation algorithms, including microtopographic features such as ice wedge polygons and organic soils. I am developing bespoke remote sensing solutions for measuring permafrost terrain changes, soil moisture, and vegetation moisture. The theoretical and empirical characterization of model and estimation errors is an integral component of my work.  |

*In the permafrost wetland with degrading ice-wedge polygons, our KMWG interferometric speckle model fits the observations better than existing models (green and yellow).*

## Ecohydrology

|<a href="http://szwieback.github.io/files/maplambda.png"><img src="http://szwieback.github.io/files/maplambda.png" align="left" width="390" ></a> | I have detected large but nevertheless subtle biases in the SMAP soil moisture product, which critical to applications as diverse as yield forecasting and drought monitoring. These biases are caused by an imperfect vegetation correction that has to be applied to convert the SMAP satellite measurements into a soil moisture product. The biases impede the detection of extreme events such as droughts, and they distort estimates of the coupling between hydrology and vegetation. |

*Biases associated with an imperfect vegetation correction correspond to positive lambda values: these are prevalent over croplands.*
