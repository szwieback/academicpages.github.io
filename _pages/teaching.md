## Digital Image Processing in the Geosciences

|<a href="http://szwieback.github.io/files/flyerdip2021.png"><img src="http://szwieback.github.io/files/zebra.png" align="left" width="390" ></a> | Image processing and analysis techniques to monitor and understand the Earth system. Geoscience applications to be addressed include thin-section analysis, remote sensing of geohazards and geomorphometry. Apart from lectures and demonstrations, the advantages and drawbacks of image processing techniques will be evaluated through exercises and a course project. |
